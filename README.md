# AI Agent Debate System

A Python project **designed to orchestrate** a structured, supervised debate between two
AI agents (**Pro** and **Con**) moderated by a **Parent/Judge** agent that will route
every message, enforce the rules, and declare a single winner.

> **Status: early development (Phase 6.2b — resource-control & run-safety primitives).**
> Implemented and tested **offline**: protocol enums/models, JSON config loading,
> structural message + evidence validation, the 0–5 scoring rubric, the deterministic
> configured tie-break (6.1), the `ProviderAdapter`/`SearchTool` abstractions with
> `MockProvider`/`MockSearchTool` (6.2a), and now the **`CostTracker` (estimate-only
> metrics), `Gatekeeper` (configurable limits), and `Watchdog` (deterministic run-level
> guard)** (6.2b) — all offline, no network/LLM. **Not implemented yet:** the real
> Claude CLI provider, real web/`ddgs` search, the Judge/Pro/Con agents, and the full
> debate runner. **A full debate cannot be run yet**, and no debate has been run — no
> results, transcripts, or evidence have been produced. The full README is authored in
> Phase 8.

## Development (skeleton)
Reproducible setup uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync                # create the environment from pyproject.toml
uv run pytest          # run the skeleton + quality tests
uv run ruff check .    # lint
```

Configuration lives in `config/*.json` (see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`). Secrets, if ever
needed, come from `.env` (gitignored); copy `.env.example` to start. The primary provider
path is the login-based Claude CLI and needs no API key.

## Current quality commands
Full details in [`docs/QUALITY.md`](docs/QUALITY.md). The gates are runnable today:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pytest -rx
uv run pytest --cov=src/agent_debate --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85
uv run mypy src scripts
uv run python scripts/check_required_docs.py
uv run python scripts/check_file_lengths.py
uv run python scripts/check_json_configs.py
```

> **Note:** the behavioral **contract tests** in `tests/integration/test_contracts.py`
> use strict `xfail` for TDD. As of **Phase 6.1**, **7** contracts are now real,
> passing, offline tests (routing, invalid JSON, missing opponent reference, missing
> evidence, irrelevant evidence, configured tie-break, prompt-injection resistance);
> the remaining **6** stay strict-`xfail` because they need the full DebateRunner, a
> real provider, or the watchdog (Phase 6.2+). Strict means an unexpected pass fails
> the gate, forcing conversion into a real test. No debate has been run; no
> results/evidence have been produced.
