# AI Agent Debate System

A Python project **designed to orchestrate** a structured, supervised debate between two
AI agents (**Pro** and **Con**) moderated by a **Parent/Judge** agent that will route
every message, enforce the rules, and declare a single winner.

> **Status: early development (Phase 4 — project skeleton).**
> The package layout, configuration templates, and tooling exist, but the debate
> orchestration, agents, providers, and search adapters are **not implemented yet**.
> This README is a placeholder; the full README (problem, setup, usage, architecture,
> debate flow, screenshots, quality commands, cost/resource awareness, limitations,
> reproducibility) is authored in Phase 8. No results or evidence have been produced yet.

## Development (skeleton)
Reproducible setup uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync                # create the environment from pyproject.toml
uv run pytest          # run the skeleton import tests
uv run ruff check .    # lint
```

Configuration lives in `config/*.json` (see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`). Secrets, if ever
needed, come from `.env` (gitignored); copy `.env.example` to start. The primary provider
path is the login-based Claude CLI and needs no API key.
